Day by day, the number of open source projects continues to increase. Each project has unique communities and practice different development methodologies. This talk will focus on the Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry cultures and outline their main differences and commonalities. The projects have different review processes from the pair programming model to the LGTM process, an interesting artifact of github. Becoming a committer on CF relies on the Dojo, while Docker establishes a meritocracy of peers and Kubernetes behaves similarly with individual sponsors. 
Morgan will share his journey of becoming a maintainer on the core Docker Engine and a founding member of the Kubernetes Service Catalog. Swetha will tell her story of becoming a contributor on the Diego team and what she has learnt from Cloud Foundry. By sharing their experiences, they hope to encourage others to participate.
